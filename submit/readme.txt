=====DNN=====
This is the model that generates our best result. 
Please put all files in the same directory, and run DNN.ipynb. 

Unfortunately, we did not set random seed in the script. 
However, we did save the best model and best prediction. 
They are model(best_result).pth and predict(best_result).csv. 

The first line of each block briefly explain the code.
